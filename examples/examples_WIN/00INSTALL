###### Steps for installation on Windows ######

(1) Prepare release tar.gz, or an equivalent tarball
    (A) A way of doing this is to created a release (or pre-release) from Github,
        and then download the *.tar.gz source code "asset" for that release.
        The benefit of this is that it excludes unnecessary files that might be
        included if just directly tarring a directory.

(2) Download to local machine

(3) Unpack folder, rename and move:
    (A) Move old dysmalpy folder C:\Programme\dysmalpy.old\

    (B) Move untarred folder (has name dysmalpy-X.X.X [version number]) & rename to
        C:\Programme\dysmalpy\

(4) Install
    (A) Open "Anaconda prompt" terminal
    (B) cd C:\Programme\dysmalpy\
    (C) python setup.py install

(5) Make sure BAT files are in correct location
    Copy dysmalpy/examples/examples_WIN/make_model_dysmalpy.bat, fitting_dysmalpy_MPFIT.bat
            to C:\Programme\dysmalpy_batch\
    Also copy make_model_3Dcube.params, fitting_1D_mpfit.params to an example location (or so).

(6) Make / ensure shortcuts to BAT files on Desktop


(7) **IMPORTANT**: Test example(s) (see 00HOWTOUSE)
    -- at least one model creation cube and one fitting.


Note: If debugging is needed to correct for Windows-specific problems,
      the errors should show up during the testing of the examples (step 7).
      Make changes as needed to the code to debug, and keep trying steps 1-7
      until everything runs without issue.
