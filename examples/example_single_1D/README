This file outlines how to fit a single galaxy's 1D velocity and dispersion
profile using the DYSMALPY wrappers and provides a description of all of the
parameters that can be tuned in the modelling and fitting procedure.

The following files should be provided in this example_single_1D directory:
-- dysmalpy_fit_1d.sh: Bash shell script to run everything
-- fitting_1D.params: Example parameter file that is input to the shell script
-- README: This file!
-- README_1D_params: Description of all parameters in fitting_1D.params
-- COS3_18434.obs_prof.txt: Example 1D data file
-- COS3_18434_1D_out/: Example output directory for fitting in 1D

Overview
--------
Fitting a single object requires the following steps:
1.) Copy this directory from AFS to the machine you will be using. Please
    do NOT perform fits that save to the DYSMALPY directory on AFS.

2.) Edit the parameters in fitting_1D.params to match your own object and needs.
    See README_1D_params for a description of each one.

3.) Start the fitting by typing the following in your terminal:
    ./dysmalpy_fit_1d.sh fitting_1D.params

The fitting should begin and you should start seeing messages appear updating
the progress of the fit.

Output Files
------------
Within the output directory that you specify in fitting_1D.params, you should
find the following files with the only difference being the name at the front
of the files will be the name of your object:

1.) COS3_18434_mcmc_best_fit_results.info
    -- Contains a nice human readable output of the best fit parameters of your
       model with uncertainties determined from the 68th percentile of the
       posterior distribution

2.) COS3_18434_mcmc_best_fit_results.dat
    -- Results of the fitting in a machine readable format with the following
       columns
        -- component: String with the model component name
        -- param_name: String with the parameter name
        -- fixed: True/False for whether model parameter was fixed or not
        -- best_value: Best fit value for the model parameter or the fixed value
        -- l68_err: lower uncertainty determined from the 16th %tile of the posterior
                    distribution; -99 if the parameter was fixed
        -- u68_err: upper uncertainty determined from the 84th %tile of the posterior
                    distribution; -99 if the parameter was fixed
    -- The last line of the table contains the reduced chi-square of the fit
       with the value in the "best_value" column.

3.) COS3_18434_mcmc_best_fit.pdf
    -- Plot of the data with the best fitting model

4.) COS3_18434_mcmc_besfit_model_cube.fits
    -- FITS file containing the best fit model cube

5.) COS3_18434_mcmc_param_corner.pdf
    -- "Corner" plot showing the joint 2D and marginalized posterior distributions
       for each free parameter
           
6.) COS3_18434_mcmc_burnin_trace.pdf
    -- Plot of every MCMC walker for every free model parameter as it evolved
       during the "burnin" phase

    -- Use this plot to assess whether the burnin phase was long enough. The
       distribution of the walkers towards the end of the burnin should look
       different than at the start. I.e the walkers should have "walked" away
       from their initial distribution.

7.) COS3_18434_mcmc_trace.pdf
    -- Plot of every MCMC walker for every free model parameter as it evolved
       during the "sampling" phase. These are the values that are used to define
       the posterior distribution of each free parameter.

    -- Use this plot to assess visually whether the parameters have converged
       on a distribution or whether more steps are needed.

8.) COS3_18434_mcmc_chain_blobs.dat
    -- Table of the values contained in the posterior distribution for each
       free parameter

9.) COS3_18434_galaxy_bestfit_vel_profile.dat
    -- Best fit circular and rotational velocity profile as a function of radius
       with steps of 0.1 kpc and a maximum of 3 effective radii

10.) COS3_18434_galaxy_model.pickle
    -- Python pickle file containing the setup for the model and the instrument

11.) COS3_18434_mcmc_results.pickle
     -- Python pickle file containing the MCMC fitting results of the run

12.) COS3_18434_mcmc_sampler.pickle
     -- Python pickle file containing the MCMC setup and chains from the fit

13.) COS3_18434_info.log
     -- Log file that records the output during the run and will show if any
        errors occurred

14.) fitting_1D.params
     -- Copy of the parameter file that was used for the fit
