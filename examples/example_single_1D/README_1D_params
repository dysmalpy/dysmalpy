This file contains a more in-depth description of each of the parameters
that can be set in fitting_1D.params. For all parameters that take a string,
quotations are not necessary.


# ******************************* OBJECT INFO **********************************

galID:  The name of your object that will be used in the file-naming.
z:      Redshift of your object


# ****************************** DATA INFO *************************************

** Note about 1D data format **
The wrapper expects your 1D data file to be an ascii file with 5 columns in the
following order:
1.) Radius in arcseconds from the center of the galaxy from negative to positive
2.) Velocity in km/s. Make sure your profile starts with the blue side
    corresponding to negative radii
3.) Velocity error in km/s.
4.) Velocity dispersion in km/s.
5.) Velocity dispersion error in km/s.

fdata: Full path to your data. If the data is inside this directory, then just
       the file name.

data_inst_corr: True/False for whether the dispersion profile has been corrected
                for the instrumental broadening.

slit_width: Circular aperture diameter in arcsecs used to create the 1D profile

slit_pa: Position angle in degrees that the apertures were placed on.
         Make sure this is towards the BLUE-SHIFTED side of your galaxy.
         -180 to 180 with 0 to the North and negative clockwise.

symmetrize_data: True/False for whether you want the data to be symmetrized.

profile1d_type: Default 1D aperture extraction shape. For now, we recommend to NOT change this parameter in the file.
aperture_radius: Circular aperture radius. Have used half slit width in past 
                   -- Eg, aperture diam = slit width
                   * If this kwarg is missing, set equal to half of the slit width by default.

psf_beta: Beta parameter for the Moffat PSF. This will have no effect if you
          choose Gaussian as your PSF shape


# **************************** SETUP MODEL *************************************

This section allows the user to change parameters associated with the specific
model they want to use to fit their data. 

For each of the model "components" (i.e. DISK+BULGE, DARK MATTER HALO, etc), 
there are parameters that can be set to vary during your fitting. 
These are listed under the "Initial Value" section.
These parameters can then be set fixed (True) or free (False) under the "Fixed?"
section with name PARAM_NAME_fixed. 
Each model parameter then also has a prior associated with it of which we provide 3 types:
1.) Flat: Uniform prior between two values.
2.) Gaussian: Gaussian prior with a central value and standard deviation and
              bounded between two values.
3.) Sine Gaussian: Gaussian prior on the sine of the parameter. Useful for
                   putting a prior on the sin(inclination). Bounds are still
                   given for the normal (non-sine) value of the parameter but the
                   standard deviation is given for the sine of the parameter.
                   (e.g.: sets center at inc=30., bounded to [10., 50.], 
                   but has sin(inc) std dev = 0.1.)

The prior type is chosen with the parameter name PARAM_NAME_prior 
and can be 'flat', 'gaussian', or 'sine_gaussian'.

For all prior types, bounds on the allowed values for the free parameter must
be given and these are set with name PARAM_NAME_bounds. 
Simply put the lower and upper bounds next to each other with a
space between them.

If a Gaussian or Sine Gaussian prior is chosen, then a standard deviation must be
given via the parameter name PARAM_NAME_stddev. 
(Again, for Sine Gaussian, the stddev must be in sine-space.)

Also, the central value for the Gaussian or Sine Gaussian prior will be taken
from the values you give under the Initial Values.

Before addressing each of the model components there are several general model
settings that can be set as well.

# Model Settings
# -------------
include_halo: True/False for including the halo component in the model.

adiabatic_contract: True/False if adiabatic contraction will be used. If True,
                    then include_halo must be set to True as well.

pressure_support: True/False if the velocities should include assymetric drift.
                  The prescription described in Burkert+16 is used.

noord_flat: True/False if Noordermeer flattening should be used.
            See Nordermeer+08.

oversample: Integer number if the model should be oversampled spatially.
            Example: If fov_npix is chosen to be 25 and oversample is 3, then
                     the model will first be generated on a 75x75 pixel grid
                     with a factor of 3 higher pixel scale and then downsampled
                     to 25x25 before extracting the 1D profile.

oversize: Integer number if the model should be first generated on a larger FOV.
          Example: If fov_npix is chosen to be 25 and oversize is 3, then the
                   model with first be generated on a 75x75 pixel grid with
                   the same pixel scale, and cropped to 25x25 before extracting
                   the 1D profile.


# DISK + BULGE
# ------------

           used to apply Noordermeer flattening if this is turned on.
           ** This is NOT a parameter that can be varied. **

n_bulge: Sersic index for bulge

invq_bulge: Disk scale length to z-height ratio for disk. This value will be
            used to apply Noordermeer flattening if this is turned on.

The dark matter halo is currently being modelled as an NFW profile. Future
versions will allow for different halo profiles such as an Einasto profile.
The virial radius is calculated based on the virial mass and redshift following
the prescription of Mo+98.

              effective radius of the disk through the invq_disk parameter.

inc_prior,           sine_gaussian

# Standard deviation of Gaussian Prior, if chosen
# No effect if Flat prior is chosen

# Note: if sine_gaussian is chosen, this is the stddev of sin_i, even though bounds and
#       center of prior are defined in angle space (inc)
inc_stddev,          0.1

## Example if normal gaussian used (eg, angle space)

# **************************** Fitting Settings ********************************

fit_method: Can be mcmc to use MCMC to perform the fitting or mpfit to use
            MPFIT to perform the fitting and determine the best fit
            parameters
do_plotting: True/False for whether to produce all of the output plots
fitdispersion: True/False for whether to simultaneously fit the
               dispersion profile along with the velocity.
               If set to False, the fitting entirely ignores
               the dispersion profile / map.

# MCMC Settings
# -------------
nWalkers: Number of walkers to use for the MCMC fitting

nCPUs: Number of CPUs to use for parallelization

scale_param_a: Scale parameter "a" that defines step sizes in parameter space.
               A value of 2-3 should be good.
               
nBurn: The number of steps to use for the burn-in phase.

nSteps: The number of steps to use during the sampling phase that defines
        the posterior distribution.

minAF: Minimum acceptance fraction to use during the test of convergence. A good
       value is 0.2. If set to None, then the fitting will run all of the steps
       defined in nSteps.

maxAF: Maximum acceptance fraction to use during the test of convergence. A good
       value is 0.5. If set to None, then the fitting will run all of the steps
       defined in nSteps.

nEff: The multiplicative factor to use during the test of convergence. If during
      the fitting process, the maximum autocorrelation time * neFF is less than
      the number of steps that have been run then the fitting will stop. A good
      value is 10, meaning that the MCMC walkers have performed a
      number of steps >= 10 times the maximum autocorrelation time of the free
      parameters. For this truncation to be applied, 
      all 3 of 'nEff', 'minAF', and 'maxAF' must be set (e.g., not 'None')


# MPFIT Settings
# --------------
maxiter: The maximum number of iterations to let MPFIT perform before it quits
